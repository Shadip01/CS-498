<h2>What We Do</h2>
At the CS-498 Research Repository, we leverage machine learning algorithms in Python to scrutinize assignments for signs of plagiarism. Our approach involves meticulous training and testing using diverse datasets to ascertain the originality of submitted work.

Using sophisticated AI techniques, we analyze the provided data against known patterns and structures to identify potential instances of plagiarism. This process not only ensures academic integrity but also promotes a culture of honesty and originality within our academic community.

Our dedicated team is committed to refining and enhancing these algorithms to stay ahead of evolving plagiarism tactics, thereby upholding the standards of academic excellence and integrity.

Through our diligent efforts, we aim to foster a scholarly environment where intellectual honesty and integrity are paramount, facilitating the pursuit of knowledge and innovation in computer science.
